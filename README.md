This is an attempt to document the most relevant papers for research in the Pollack lab into RNA structure-function and RNA-protein interactions. Inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins) 


Papers within each category are listed in reverse chronoligcal order. Categories subject to reorganization as the collection develops, and tags are included for easier searching. 

# Categories:
